# discriminative-vs-generative-classification
A short tutorial illustrating the difference between discriminative and generative classifiers with multilabel document classification

This short project demonstrates the difference in the mechanisms of discriminative and generative classifiers. It uses as example a multilabel document classification task and compares two basic classifiers, logistic regression and naive Bayes. Compared to other resources online, which make use of numeric features or other abstractions, the use of text examples in this project makes it explicitly clear how the different mechanisms work from a pedagogical perspective.
